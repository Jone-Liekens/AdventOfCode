# AdventOfCode

My solutions to the Advent of Code problems (https://adventofcode.com), written in Python

Each day-folder contains:
- main.ipynb: a Jupyter Notebook containing the solution for both parts of the challenge
- data.txt: the puzzle input
- test*.txt: smaller and simpler example input (provided by the problem description)

Code for days 1 - 5 is not available (because I deleted the code before pushing it to github)
